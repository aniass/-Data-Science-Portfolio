# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains my Data Science/ Machine Learning and Python programming projects which shows my all self-study progress. Some projects are still in progress.

## Projects

## Deep Learning:
### [Document Classification](https://github.com/aniass/Document-Classification-NLP)

The project concerns the text classification of make-up products based on their description and categories. We have build  multi-class text classification model (with ML alorithms, MLP and CNN). From our data  we also have trained Word2vec and Doc2vec model  and we have created Topic Modeling and EDA analysis.

- **Models used:**  TF-IDF, Word2vec, Doc2vec; Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, MLP and CNN.
- **Keywords**: NLP, Topic modeling, Python: nltk, gensim, keras, sklearn, LDA.

### [Face Detection](https://github.com/aniass/Face-Detection-with-OpenCV)

In this project used OpenCV library to detect faces, eyes and smile in an image.
- **Models used:** OpenCV: Harr Classifier.
- **Keywords**: face detection, Python: OpenCV, numpy, matplotlib.
## Machine learning:
**ML supervised & unsupervised  and Natural Language Processing**:

### [Sentiment analysis reviews](https://github.com/aniass/Sentiment-analysis-reviews)

The project concerns sentiment analysis of women's clothes reviews. We have build model by using different machine learning algorithms to determined if the product is recommended or not. The project also includes EDA analysis and sentiment analysis by using Vader and TextBlob methods.
- **Models used:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM; TextBlob, Vader.
- **Keywords**: NLP, Sentiment analysis, Python: nltk, scikit-learn.

### [Customer segmentation ](https://github.com/aniass/Customer-segmentation)

The project contains customer segmentation by using the RFM method and K-Means clustering for creating customer segments based on data provided.
- **Keywords**: RFM method, K-Means clustering, Python.

### [Market Basket analysis](https://github.com/aniass/Market-basket-analysis)

The project concerns market basket analysis and product recomendation by using the association methods. We have build model by using the Apriori algorithm to products recomendation based on our data.
- **Models used:** Apriori algorithm.
- **Keywords**: product recomendation, data analysis, python, MLxtend.

### [Spam detection](https://github.com/aniass/Spam-detection)

The project concerns spam detection in SMS messages to determine whether the messages is spam or not. The analysis includes spam classification and text mining with NLP methods to prepare and clean data.
- **Models used:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting.
- **Keywords**: NLP, spam detection, classification, smote sampling, python, nltk, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn.

### [Real Estate price prediction](https://github.com/aniass/Real-Estate-price-prediction)

The project concerns real estate price prediction using linear regression models. We have build a model which predict real estate price based on historical data.
- **Models used:** Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, Gradient Descent, XGBoost.
- **Keywords**: Linear regression, Python: Scikit-learn, Kaggle dataset.

### [Sales forecasting](https://github.com/aniass/Task-Analyst)

The project concerns sales forecasting by using time series model. The project includes sales data analysis and forecast of the number of orders by using Prophet library.
- **Models used:** Time Series.
- **Keywords**: Exploratory data analysis, Prophet, python.

## Data analysis:
### [IT job market analysis](https://github.com/aniass/IT-job-market-analysis)

The project concerns the analysis of the IT job market using data from GitHub, StackOverflow and Web scraping data. We have used SQL, Google Big Query and python data analysis libraries to analyze our data.
- **Keywords**: data preprocessing, data cleaning, EDA, Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn; SQL, Google BigQuery. 

### [Excel to sqlite database with python](https://github.com/aniass/Excel-to-sqlite-database-with-python)

This Python script allows to match excel file with data from the database. We create an engine to connect with our database and load chose data into pandas dataframes. We select and filter data from database and match them to data comes from excel file.
- **Keywords**: python, SQLite, pandas.
