* [Titanic prediction](https://github.com/aniass/Titanic-Machine-Learning)

The project concerns predicting the survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning approaches. 

**Keywords**: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning classification, Kaggle dataset, python, scikit-learn. 

### NLP:
* [Document Classification](https://github.com/aniass/Document-Classification-NLP)

The project concerns the multi-class text classification to make-up products based on their description and categories. 

The analysis includes: the multi-class text classification with:  ML algorithms,  Neural Network and CNN model, Doc2vec model, Word2vec model. 
Topic Modeling and EDA analysis of makeup products.

**Keywords**: NLP, Topic modeling, Doc2vec, Word2vec, data analysis, machine learning classification, CNN, python, nltk, gensim, keras, sklearn, LDA.

* [Sentiment analysis reviews](https://github.com/aniass/Sentiment-analysis-reviews)

The project concerns sentiment analysis of women's clothes reviews to determined whether the product is recommended or not. The analysis includes sentiment analysis and exploratory data analysis.

**Keywords**: NLP, sentiment analysis, data analysis, machine learning classification, python, nltk, scikit-learn.

### Computer vision/Deep Learning:
* [Face Detection](https://github.com/aniass/Face-Detection-with-OpenCV)

In this project used OpenCV library to detect faces, eyes and smile in an image.

**Keywords**: face detection, python, OpenCV, numpy, matplotlib.

### Data analysis:
* [IT job market analysis](https://github.com/aniass/IT-job-market-analysis)

The project concerns the analysis of the IT job market using data from GitHub, StackOverflow and other data sources.

**Keywords**: data preprocessing, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, SQL, Google BigQuery. 

### Python projects:
* [Extracting data using API](https://github.com/aniass/Extracting-data-using-API)

In this project used the API to get the data and create a dataset. These are two examples of get the data from an API. The data received was saved in json format. Then they were exported to a csv file.

**Keywords**: python, requests, pandas, json.

* [CSV Report Processing](https://github.com/aniass/CSV_Report_Processing)

This Python script allows one to read a CSV file entered by the user, it changes the data contained in and returns the transformed data as a new CSV one.

**Keywords**: python, pycountry.

## Workshops:
The some several workshops in which I participated:

* DataWorkshop challenge (02-10.2019): 

Challenge for beginners includes five workshops about Data Science. The topics concern [Machine Learning](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-1), [Deep Learning](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-2), [Autonomous cars](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-3), [NLP](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-4), [Time Series](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-5). 

* Matrix challenge (02-04.2020):

5 days challenge initialized by DataWorkshop consisting of three parts: [Machine Learning](https://github.com/aniass/dw_matrix), [Car price forecasting](https://github.com/aniass/dw_matrix_car), [Prediction road sign by computer vision ](https://github.com/aniass/dw_matrix_road_sign).
