# Portfolio

This repository contains my Data Science/ Machine Learning and Python programming projects and information about education courses which shows my self-study progress. Some of projects are still in progress.

## Projects
### Machine learning:

* [Sentiment analysis reviews](https://github.com/aniass/Sentiment-analysis-reviews)

The project concerns sentiment analysis of women's clothes reviews to determined whether the product is recommended or not. The analysis includes sentiment analysis and exploratory data analysis.

**Keywords**: NLP, sentiment analysis, data analysis, machine learning classification, python, nltk, scikit-learn.

* [Document Classification](https://github.com/aniass/Document-Classification-NLP)

The project concerns the multi-class text classification to make-up products based on their description and categories. The analysis includes the multi-class text classification, Topic Modeling, creation Word2vec model and EDA analysis of makeup products.

**Keywords**: NLP, Topic modeling, Word2vec, data analysis, machine learning classification, python, nltk, gensim, sklearn, LDA.

* [Market Basket analysis](https://github.com/aniass/Market-basket-analysis)

The project concerns market basket analysis and product recomendation by using the Apriori algorithm (association method). The project includes EDA analysis and basket analysis by the using Apriori algorithm.

**Keywords**: MLxtend, data analysis, Apriori algorithm, python.

* [Face Detection](https://github.com/aniass/Face-Detection-with-OpenCV)

In this project used OpenCV library to detect faces, eyes and smile in an image.

**Keywords**: face detection, python, OpenCV, numpy, matplotlib.

* [Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/aniass/Diabetes-Prediction)

This project concern predicting the diabetes in a patient using different Machine Learning approaches (Logistic regression, KNN and Decision tree). 

**Keywords**: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning classification, Kaggle dataset, comparision of models, python, scikit-learn. 

* [Titanic prediction](https://github.com/aniass/Titanic-Machine-Learning)

The project concerns predicting the survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning approaches. 

**Keywords**: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning classification, Kaggle dataset, python, scikit-learn. 

### Data analysis:
* [IT job market analysis](https://github.com/aniass/IT-job-market-analysis)

The project concerns the analysis of the IT job market using data from GitHub, StackOverflow and other data sources.

**Keywords**: data preprocessing, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, SQL, Google BigQuery. 

### Python projects:
* [Web Scraping](https://github.com/aniass/IT-job-market-analysis/blob/master/AS_web-scraping.ipynb)

Web scraping from page Indeed.com.

* [Extracting data using API](https://github.com/aniass/Extracting-data-using-API)

In this project used the API to get the data and create a dataset. These are two examples of get the data from an API. The data received was saved in json format. Then they were exported to a csv file.

**Keywords**: python, requests, pandas, json.

* [CSV Report Processing](https://github.com/aniass/CSV_Report_Processing)

This Python script allows one to read a CSV file entered by the user, it changes the data contained in and returns the transformed data as a new CSV one.

**Keywords**: python, pycountry.

## Education
The some several workshops in which I participated.

### Workshops:

* DataWorkshop challenge (02-10.2019): 

Challenge for beginners includes five workshops about Data Science. The topics concern [Machine Learning](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-1), [Deep Learning](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-2), [Autonomous cars](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-3), [NLP](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-4), [Time Series](https://github.com/aniass/DataWorkshop-challenge-5). 

* Matrix challenge (02-04.2020):

5 days challenge initialized by DataWorkshop consisting of three parts: [Machine Learning](https://github.com/aniass/dw_matrix), [Car price forecasting](https://github.com/aniass/dw_matrix_car), [Prediction road sign by computer vision ](https://github.com/aniass/dw_matrix_road_sign).
